			'As a Full-Stack Engineer, I played a key role in maintaining and enhancing our React front-end and NodeJS back-end services. Alongside a collaborative team, we efficiently managed our infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation and the Serverless Framework. Testing was a priority, so we utilized Cypress, Jest, and Mocha to ensure robustness, even during peak campaigns like Red Nose Day. Collaboration was vitalâ€”I closely engaged with stakeholders and team members to keep our digital fundraising projects on track.
