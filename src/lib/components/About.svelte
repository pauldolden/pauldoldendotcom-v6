	Hi, I'm Paul. I'm based in the East of England and currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at
	the Football Association, building applications to help England teams succeed. I love writing code
	and enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies. Currently, I'm working with Svelte,
	TypeScript, Go, and TailwindCSS. I have a particular passion for building for the cloud and am a
	big fan of the serverless paradigm. I also have a keen interest in the world of DevOps and CI/CD.
	When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, watching football, and, much less
	frequently, playing video games. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email
	here or connect with me on LinkedIn.
